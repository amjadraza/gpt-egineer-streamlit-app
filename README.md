This project includes `Dockerfile` to run the app in Docker container. In order to optimise the Docker Image
size and building time with cache techniques, I have follow tricks in below Article 
https://medium.com/@albertazzir/blazing-fast-python-docker-builds-with-poetry-a78a66f5aed0

Build the docker container

``docker  build . -t gpt-engineer-streamlit-app:latest ``

To generate Image with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT`, follow below command

```DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --target=runtime . -t gpt-engineer-streamlit-app:latest```

1. Run the docker container directly 

``docker run -d --name gpt-engineer-streamlit-app:latest -p 8080:8080 langchain-chat-app ``

2. Run the docker container using docker-compose (Recommended)

``docker-compose up``
